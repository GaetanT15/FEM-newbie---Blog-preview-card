## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Nested CSS with component-based organization
- Flexbox
- CSS `clamp()` for responsive typography
- Separated UI kit section for fonts
- Smooooooooooth transitions for hover effects

### What I learned

During this project, I took the time to really understand and implement CSS `clamp()` for responsive typography. I experimented with it extensively and dove into the documentation to grasp how it works. It's an incredibly powerful tool! While I'm not completely comfortable with it yet, I know it will come with practice. I've definitely adopted it for future projects.


### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to focus on:

- Better CSS architecture, particularly for the UI kit section. This will naturally improve as I tackle larger projects beyond simple card components
- More efficient font management and import strategies, moving away from relying solely on Google Fonts
